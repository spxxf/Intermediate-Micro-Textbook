# Welcome! 

### Goal
This project aims to build an online textbook that any student can use to develop an intuition for topics in their intermediate-level microeconomics course through the use of animations and interactive graphs.

### References
This book is being written using Professor Jennifer Hunt's lecture notes for 01:220:320, Intermediate Microeconomics, at Rutgers and Perloff's 5th edition of *Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus* as references.

### Warning
This book is not meant to replace a course textbook; it is designed to supplement a primary reading source so students can build confidence on more complex topics.
