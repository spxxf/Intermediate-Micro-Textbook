[["index.html", "Interactive Intermediate Microeconomics About Notes Prerequisites Usage", " Interactive Intermediate Microeconomics Yogi Gohel 2022-07-19 About This book is designed to help students develop an intuition for intermediate microeconomic concepts using interactive plots and animations. By no means is this a replacement for your course textbook; it should serve as a supplement that builds confidence towards more complex topics. Notes This book is still a work in progress, so there is a chance you will find typos or inconsistencies. Please let me know if you find any at yogi (dot) gohel (at) rutgers (dot) edu. All chapters besides Chapter 1, Consumer Behavior, are placeholders. They will be updated as work on the book proceeds. Prerequisites This book assumes familiarity with topics covered in an introductory microeconomics course and univariate differential calculus; at Rutgers these are 01:220:102 and 01:640:135/151, respectively. Usage While it is not recommended, you can view this book on a smaller device such as a phone. The plots will still be interactive, but they do not properly scale to the smaller screen. For the best reading experience, use a laptop or computer. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
